EduCube is a 1U Cubesat developed specifically for educational purposes. It is used in a hands-on training laboratory for masters students to allow them to gain familiarity with the satellite subsystems found in a Cubesat. EduCube was designed and built in-house and is largely compliant with the Cal Poly standard.
